#HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT ON YOUR COMPUTER

You will need NODE installed, then clone the repository or zip and download it, open it up via command line (terminal) and run it with NPM or YARN depending on which one you have installed on your computer

#STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT
The project is structured in assets, components, containers and contexts. 

With CONTEXTS we can access the global state of the application and easily manage the main aspect of the project: the survivors. 

In COMPONENTS we have everything that can be reutilize OR will be used numberous times in various parts of the application

In CONTAINERS we have everything that uses the "state" provided with the context

In ASSETS we have the fake initial list of survivors and the default avatar image for survivors
